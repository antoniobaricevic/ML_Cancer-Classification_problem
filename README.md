# Machine Learning Cancer - Classification problem
The goal is to predict if the cancer is: 2 - benign or 4 - malignant, and compare XGBoost and CatBoost to other ML algorithms.

#### Data set information:
This dataset is publicly available. This breast cancer databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg.
